# Alex Brown

I'm a self-taught web-developer, currently located in Adelaide, Australia. I love learning both the front and back-end. 

### I'm currently looking for my first full-time position, so reach out if you're looking for a front-end or fullstack dev. 

Some of my other recent work includes an article about how React Fiber's async rendering will affect current React
component life cycle methods, [which you can read here](https://medium.com/@awebofbrown/how-to-safely-use-reacts-life-cycles-with-fiber-s-async-rendering-fd4469ebbd8f).

I also recently open sourced [React-MQL-Manager](https://github.com/AWebOfBrown/React-MQL-Manager), 
which I mention in the panel to the right. A demo with React Router, demonstrating the responsive routing 
example from React Router's docs, can be found [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/lo3p1wkjz).
